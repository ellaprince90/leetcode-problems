Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.



class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:

        stack = []
        matching = {"(" :")", "{":"}", "[":"]"}

        for i in s:
            if i in "({[":
                stack.append(i)
            elif i in ")}]":
                if not stack:
                    return False
                last_open = stack.pop()
                if matching[last_open] != i:
                    return False

        return not stack
